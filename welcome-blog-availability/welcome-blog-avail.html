        <h2>Welcome to our cottage!</h2> 
        <p>We discovered the Belgrade Lakes area a few years ago, on a beautiful autumn day. After exploring the small town of Belgrade, we hiked French Mountain* and made plans to return the following summer for a longer family vacation. That vacation sealed the deal. After renting our fair share of cottages over the years, we knew we wanted a place of our own that we could also share with others.</p>

        <p>Please make yourself at home and enjoy this slice of heaven. If you have any issues or even simple questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to give us a call. We continue to work towards improving this Maine Life experience, so if there is anything you think we can do to enhance or add to the cottage, please let us know.</p>
